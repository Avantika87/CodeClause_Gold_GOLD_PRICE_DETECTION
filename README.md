3️⃣ Data Wrangling <br>
4️⃣ Dataset Balancing & Scaling <br>
5️⃣ Machine Learning Model Training and Evaluation


## Prerequisites:
Before the hacknight, it is advised to have a ready-to-use toolchain and development environment.A recommended set of tools contains : <br>


1️⃣ `Python`<br>
2️⃣ `scikit-learn` / `sklearn`<br>
3️⃣ `Pandas`<br>
4️⃣ `NumPy`<br>
5️⃣ `Seaborn`<br>
6️⃣ An environment to work in - something like `Jupyter` or `colab`<br>

For Linux people, your package manager should be able to handle all of this. If it somehow can't, see if you can at least install Python and pip and then use pip to install the above packages.

## Dataset:

> You can collect raw dataset from [here](gld_price_data.csv).

Attribute Information:<br>
1️⃣ `Date` <br>
2️⃣ `SPX` <br>
3️⃣ `GLD` <br>
